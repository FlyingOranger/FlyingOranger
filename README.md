2. In the directory that pops up, create a new JavaScript file wit the name of your App

### Example
[Video creating an example app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEGvrCrHmB0)

The app file is constructed with the following properties
```javascript
// this example wants to notify us when there is a new top daily post
// to https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/top/?sort=top&t=day

module.exports = {

  // this is the path to what you're going to check on reddit
  path: "/r/aww/top/",

  // these are the queries that come after the '?' on the URL
  queries: {
    sort: "top",
    t: "day"
  },
  
  // this will add a checkbox in the task tray menu
  // so the user can decide what they want
  // default is false ( unchecked )
  settings: {
    "Week Instead of Day": false
  },
  
  // unused in this example actually, 
  // but these are the scopes for this app
  // if we needed access to a user's account
  // more info can be found at https://www.reddit.com/dev/api
  scope: [ "privatemessages", "modconfig" ],
  
  // the rate at which we will check reddit, 30 seconds
  interval: 30,
  
  // the meat of the app, our function that gets called
  // with the data from our request to reddit
  cb: function( data, helper ){
  
    // You can see all the properties of the helper object and post object 
    // below this example
    
    // check the settings
    if ( helper.settings[ "Week Instead of Day" ] )
      module.exports.queries.t = "week"
    else
      module.exports.queries.t = "day"
    
    
    // onto the data we got from our request
    if ( data.length > 0 ){
      
      var oldPostId = helper.get("oldPostId"),
          newestPost = data[0];
          
      // if the new post's id isn't equal
      // we know we have a new post
      if ( newestPost.id !== oldPostId){
        
        // save the newest post's id for next time
        helper.set("oldPostId", newestPost.id);
        
        // we use the notify function to communicate
        // with our graphical interface
        helper.notify( "New top r/aww!", newestPost.url );
      
    } // end if

  } // end callback function

} // end module.exports
```

### Data
This is an array posts / comments.

The most important parts of the data object are: 
```
{
    id:         a unique id just for this post,
    score:      reddit's score for this post,
    is_self:    true / false,
    title:      the title of this post,
    url:        link of this post
}
```
There are more as well, just console.log(data) to see

### Helper 
The helper object contains information and functions to speed up development

#### `helper.first` 
Boolean that refers to if this is the first time that this notification app has been called.

#### `helper.settings[ "your setting name" ]`
Returns the value of the settings, be sure the "your setting name" matches exactly
        
#### `helper.set( dataName, dataToSave )`
Saves dataToSave inbetween requests, with the specified dataName

#### `helper.get( dataName )`
Returns the dataToSave inbetween requests from the specified dataName

#### `helper.more() `
Calls your function again, but with 100 more posts after the last previous post

#### `helper.notify( Title, Link, [ willFly ] )`
Sends a notification to the user

* `Title`:  is what is shown in flying banner along with notification in task bar
* `Link`:   is what is your browser opens to when the user clicks on the notification
If the link matches another link already in the task tray, then the banner is flown but not added to the tray (avoid duplicates)
* `willFly`: Optional, is a boolean saying whether or not to fly the banner.
Default is `true`
